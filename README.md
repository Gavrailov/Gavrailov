## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Anton Gavrailov, an aspiring developer focusing on AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning). I graduated as an Industrial Engineer from the Technical University in Sofia and am currently nearing the completion of my Masterâ€™s degree in AI at Sofia University - FMI.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use Java at a higher level and exploring front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also dabbling with databases such as MongoDB and Spring Boot.

âš¡ At one point in my life, I played professional video games, which fueled my competitiveness and drives my ambition in programming to continually improve.
